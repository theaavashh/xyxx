# Mailjet Email Integration for Distributor Approval Notifications

This document describes the implementation of email notifications using Mailjet when admin approves distributor applications.

## Overview

The system now automatically sends email notifications to distributors when their applications are approved. The emails are sent using Mailjet's API and include:

1. **Approval notification** - Basic approval message
2. **Approval with credentials** - Approval message including login credentials
3. **Professional HTML templates** - Beautiful, responsive email templates

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

1. **Automatic Email Sending**
   - Emails sent when applications are approved via admin panel
   - Emails sent when credentials are set for approved distributors
   - Both authenticated and development endpoints supported

2. **Two Email Templates**
   - `distributor_approved` - Basic approval notification
   - `distributor_approved_with_credentials` - Approval with login credentials

3. **Professional Design**
   - Responsive HTML templates
   - Branded styling with gradients and modern design
   - Mobile-friendly layout
   - Clear call-to-action sections

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallback if email service fails
   - Detailed logging for debugging
   - Non-blocking email sending (approval process continues even if email fails)

5. **Test Endpoints**
   - Development-only test endpoints for email verification
   - Support for testing both email templates

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Mailjet Configuration
MAILJET_API_KEY="your_mailjet_api_key_here"
MAILJET_SECRET_KEY="your_mailjet_secret_key_here"
MAILJET_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
MAILJET_FROM_NAME="Your Company Name"

# Alternative SMTP Configuration (if not using Mailjet)
SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASS="your_app_password"
```

### Getting Mailjet Credentials

1. Sign up for a Mailjet account at [mailjet.com](https://mailjet.com)
2. Go to Account Settings ‚Üí API Key Management
3. Create a new API key pair
4. Copy the API Key and Secret Key to your environment variables

## Usage

### Automatic Email Sending

Emails are automatically sent in these scenarios:

1. **Application Approval** (`/api/applications/:id/status`)
   - When admin approves an application
   - Includes basic approval information
   - May include credentials if user account is created immediately

2. **Credentials Setting** (`/api/distributors/:id/credentials`)
   - When admin sets credentials for an approved distributor
   - Includes full login credentials and assigned categories

### Test Endpoints (Development Only)

Test the email functionality using these endpoints:

```bash
# Test email with credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test/email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "template": "distributor_approved_with_credentials"
  }'

# Test email without credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test/email-without-credentials \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com"
  }'
```

## Email Content Examples

### Approval Email (With Credentials)

```html
üéâ Congratulations! Your Distributor Application Has Been Approved

üîê Your Login Credentials:
Username: dist_abc123

3. Complete your profile setup
4. Review available products and pricing
5. Contact our support team for any assistance

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Service Initialization**: Logs warning if Mailjet credentials are missing
2. **Email Sending**: Catches and logs errors without failing the main process
3. **Template Generation**: Falls back to default template if specific template fails
4. **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of API failures

## Monitoring and Logging

All email activities are logged with the following information:

- Email recipient
- Email subject
- Template used
- Success/failure status
- Error details (if any)
- Timestamp

Example log entries:
```
[INFO] Mailjet service initialized successfully
[INFO] Email sent successfully via Mailjet { to: "john@example.com", subject: "üéâ Distributor Application Approved", messageId: "123456" }
[ERROR] Failed to send email via Mailjet { to: "invalid@email", error: "Invalid email address" }
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Credentials Protection**: Passwords are only sent via email, not logged
2. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data stored in environment variables
3. **Template Validation**: Email templates are sanitized to prevent injection
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for email endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**
   - Check Mailjet API credentials
   - Verify email addresses are valid
   - Check network connectivity
   - Review application logs

2. **Template rendering issues**
   - Verify data structure matches template expectations
   - Check for missing required fields
   - Review HTML template syntax

3. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify Mailjet API key and secret
   - Check account status and billing
   - Ensure API key has send permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

This will provide detailed logs for email operations.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Email Templates Management**: Admin interface for managing email templates
2. **Multi-language Support**: Templates in different languages
3. **Email Scheduling**: Delayed sending for better deliverability
4. **Analytics Integration**: Track email open rates and engagement
5. **Template Customization**: Company branding and customization options

## Support

For issues related to email functionality:

1. Check the application logs for error messages
2. Verify Mailjet account status and billing
3. Test using the development endpoints
4. Review environment variable configuration

---

**Note**: This integration is designed to be robust and production-ready. The email service will gracefully handle failures without affecting the core distributor approval workflow.
